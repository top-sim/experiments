# Results were generated with the following parameters.

This directory is a staging directory for testing out to run experiments with TopSim

I've managed to get one working with `run_skaworkflows_test_experiment.py`. This uses the Batch Allocation approach to planning/scheduling, generating similar results to a schedule produced by the parametric model. 

It would be nice to automate the output of running the parametric model. This directory will also look into that.
