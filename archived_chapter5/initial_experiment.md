This experiment aims to compare the scheduling performance of single-observation workflows using the TopSim simulation environment. 

Our interest is in seeing the variation in performance between dynamic, queue based scheduling policies, and static scheduling policies. 

The inputs will be the squence of HPSOs tested in Chapr 4. Comparisons will be baselined to the dynamic allocation strategy, over varying degrees of delays to provide variation in the runtime and determine the responsiveness of the scheduling approach. s
