# Extending the initial results

This is exploring why the initial results demonstrate such a significant increase in schedule length based on the addition of the data.

We generate this by copying over an example HPSO (HPSO01) and removing the transfer data from this, to give us run time without data, runtime with just task_data, and run_time with both. 

- Use the shadow config and run a single FCFS from SHADOW
