These results will be generated with the following parameters.

- Maximam imaging workflows (ICAL, DPrepA-DPrepD)
- Workflows with and without data 
- Data on tasks without data on edges
- Data on tasks with data on edges
- Channels: 512 and 896
- Compute nodes: 896 and 512 (restriced nodes) 
- Parametric model: Also '896' node equivalent; this means not reserving nodes for ingest, and scheduling across the entire cluster
    - We will adjust the Parametric model result with the 512 nodes post-experiment
