# Generic Data


This data is 'random' test data that demonstrates how simulations can be set up. We use 'real' workflow shapes with arbitrary costs and cluster data. It is still possible to demonstrate the effect of different sizes of observations, clusters, workflows task-costs, and scheduing heuristics have on the throughput of the mid-term schedule. 

`shadow_continuum_ChannelSplit_10.json` is built from an (outdated) script in the `SHADOW` graph library. It is an EAGLE graph that has been unrolled by DALiuGE, with different scatter values used in the minor loop.
